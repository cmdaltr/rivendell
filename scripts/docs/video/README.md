# The YouTube walkthrough

Rivendell's narrated walkthrough is filmed with Playwright against a running stack, narrated by
Piper and put together with ffmpeg. `regenerate.sh` also retakes the in-app guide's photographs,
because both show the same pages.

The scripts here are kept locally and never committed: `.gitignore` excludes everything in this
folder except this README.

## Regenerating

With Rivendell running (`rivendell start`):

```bash
scripts/docs/video/regenerate.sh               # guide photographs, then the video
scripts/docs/video/regenerate.sh --refilm      # after a change to the web UI
scripts/docs/video/regenerate.sh --video-only  # or --guide-only
```

It asks for the admin password in a dialog, unless `RIVENDELL_PASSWORD` is already set. A
full render takes about 25 minutes.

Any other options are passed to `make_video.py`:

```bash
scripts/docs/video/regenerate.sh --video-only --only eru         # just the Eru section
scripts/docs/video/regenerate.sh --video-only --preview          # silent, to check the filming
```

The guide's photographs (`src/web/frontend/public/guide/`) are part of the app, so commit them
when they change. The script reminds you.

## What it needs

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Playwright and Chromium | `~/.cache/rivendell-video` (created on the first run if missing) |
| Piper and the `en_GB-alan-medium` voice | `~/.local/share/piper` (install steps at the top of `make_video.py`) |
| ffmpeg | `brew install ffmpeg` |
| A finished demo case | see below |

## Settings

These are set as environment variables. The defaults are what the current video uses.

| Variable | Default | What |
|---|---|---|
| `CASE_DIR` | `/Volumes/Portable6TB/Data/rivendell/claude_testing/threatintel_demo` | The finished Elrond case shown in the video |
| `CASE_ID` | `THREATINTEL-DEMO-01` | Its case ID in the web UI. Eru and the Job page use this case's newest job |
| `INTEGRITY` | `…/volatility_order_win3/elrond_intake/LAB-WIN11/gandalf_integrity.csv` | A `gandalf_integrity.csv`, used when the case has none |
| `OUT` | `~/Desktop` | Where the video goes |

The narration expects the lab's Windows machine: the techniques **T1070.006**, **T1564.004**
and **T1546.003**, and IOCs under `rivendell-lab.test`.

The Jobs scene films the real job list, so delete or archive any test jobs first.

## What comes out

In `OUT`:

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `rivendell-walkthrough.mp4` | The video, with chapters |
| `rivendell-walkthrough.srt` | Captions |
| `chapters.txt` | The chapter list for the YouTube description |
| `thumbnail.jpg` | 1280×720 |
| `scenes/` | The render cache. Keep it so later renders only redo what changed |

## Adding or reordering sections

`scenes.py` holds a list called `SECTIONS`, one section per feature or component. Each section
is a YouTube chapter, fades in from black and fades out to black. To add a feature, add a
section wherever it belongs; to reorder, move the blocks. Nothing outside a section refers to
it.

```python
{
    "id": "pippin",                      # unique: it names the files in scenes/
    "chapter": "Pippin: threat intelligence",
    "scenes": [
        {
            "id": "pippin",
            "visual": {"kind": "page", "url": "/intel", "actions": [("wait", 2)]},
            "text": "What's said while the page is on screen.",
        },
    ],
},
```

A scene's visual is a title card (`card`), a page of the web UI (`page`) or a terminal
(`terminal`). The docstring at the top of `scenes.py` lists the actions a page scene can take.
`SPOKEN` in `scenes.py` sets how Piper pronounces terms the captions spell out
(for example ATT&CK, JSON).

## Caching

- **Scenes** are cached by section and scene ID. A scene is only filmed and narrated again
  when its narration or visual changes.
- **Sections** are only joined again when one of their scenes changes.
- **The final video** is joined from the sections without re-encoding them.

The cache can't see a change to the web UI itself, such as a new nav icon or a restyled page.
After one of those, run with `--refilm`, which films the web UI scenes again. Cards and
terminals come from the cache.

## When something looks wrong

- **A scene logs `… not found, skipped`:** a selector in `scenes.py` no longer matches the UI.
  Fix the selector, then re-run with `--only <section>`.
- **The welcome covers the pages:** the render marks the welcome as already shown, using the
  key the app reads (`rivendell.offeredAt` in localStorage, `OFFERED` in `make_video.py`). If
  the app's key changes, change `OFFERED` to match.
- **Eru's answers don't appear:** without Ollama, Eru shows its offline questions, which are
  the ones `scenes.py` clicks. With a model running, the buttons are different.
- **The log stays empty until the end:** that's normal when the output isn't going to a
  terminal. Progress shows in `scenes/` as each scene is written.
