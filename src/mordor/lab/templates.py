"""
The machines you can create here. Each template names the engine that runs it, the OS it
records, and the image per architecture. offered() keeps only the ones this host can run,
and picks the image for the host's CPU — so on an Apple Silicon Mac the list gives a Linux
container, a Linux VM and a macOS VM. There is no Windows template: Docker and Tart can't run
Windows, and UTM (which does, via QEMU) has no create-from-image. A Windows VM is built in the
UTM app (or by ./lab.sh windows-vm create) and then managed from Your machines (engines.UTM).

A template says what a recording can capture on it, so the page can tie a machine back to the
telemetry it produces.
