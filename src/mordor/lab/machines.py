"""
The lifecycle of a lab machine, the same verbs for a container or a VM: create (from a
template), start, stop, snapshot, revert (to a snapshot), delete, status and logs. Each verb
dispatches to the engine that runs the machine (engines).

A machine Rivendell made is tagged in the registry with its template, so the page shows its OS
and what it records, and provisioning knows which script to run. The lab's own machines and any
UTM VM are listed too. Ported from Archer; the lab is admin-only in Rivendell, so there's no
per-user ownership.
